Incremental(Clicker?) game

A Small World

Fun with buttons and size and viewing windows.

Screen expands with "Achievements".



Questions:
1) How do we do User Interface? Scales? Is positional? Is unlockable?

Positional and Unlockable?

2) Are we going somewhere with this? I'd vote for a microscopic grid of buttons, that possibly gain sentience and run away.

Murder???

3) Do we allow the user to alter his direction and how and where? (STAGES OR FLAGS?)

Nope

4) Do acheivements work as gates or currency?

Gates, currently

5) Who are we fighting?
